It has a corporation limit population of 609,224 and a metropolitan population of more than 2 million, making it the second largest metropolitan area in

Kozhikode is classified as a Tier 2 city by the Government of India.It is the largest city in the region known as the Malabar and was the capital of the British-era Malabar district.

                                                            The exact origin of the name Kozhikode is uncertain. According to many sources, the name Kozhikode is derived from Koyil-kota (fort), meaning fortified palace. Koil or Koyil or Kovil is the Malayalam/Tamil term for a Hindu temple, referring to the Tali Shiva Temple. Both the terms kōyil and kōvil are used interchangeably. The name also got corrupted into Kolikod, or its Arab version Qāliqūṭ and later its anglicized version Calicut.[17] The Arab merchants called it Qāliqūṭ (IPA: qˠaːliqˠːuːtˤ).Chinese merchants called it Kūlifo. Tamils called it as Kallikottai.

                                                            The city is officially named Kozhikode in Malayalam, and in English, it is known by its anglicised version, Calicut.The word calico, 
                                                            a fine variety of hand-woven cotton cloth that was exported from the port of Kozhikode, is thought to have been derived from Calicut.The term for tricolour cats called calico cats, is as well derived from the fabric name.

                    Kerala as it is here that Vasco-da-Gama first landed and the legendary Spice Route came into existence.
                     This region still has a historic charm to it. Kozhikode Beach is the personification of the numerous characteristics
                      that make Kozhikode so unique.
                    
                    People flock in large numbers to view the sunset from the beach. One gets a fresh supply of seafood in the shacks that surround the place.
                     Kallumekaya (mussels) is a local favourite. A walk to Dolphins Point at dawn ensures a meeting with playful dolphins. You are also greeted by a majestic lighthouse and two piers opening into the sea. Both have been here for over a hundred years. Children flock to Lions Park and the nearby marine water aquarium which is open on all days from 08:00 hrs to 20:00 hrs.

                <span class="firstLetter">K</span><br><p>nown as the Gavi of Malabar, Vayalada is a mesmerizing hilltop destination located near Balusseri in Kozhikode district. Like the famous hill station of Gavi at Pathanamthitta, Vayalada has a nip in the air, with mist and greenery all around.   

                    The scenic peak is located 40 km from Kozhikode and 12 km from Balusseri. Situated 2,000 ft above sea level, the hill is a favourite among weekend trekkers.
                    <br><br>
                    
                    The one km-odd trekking amid great scenery is worth the climb. Once at the top, a magical treat awaits visitors and if it is the season of monsoon, then the hill station exudes a bewitching charm. The rain and mist conjure up an environment that we would never want to miss. The soft breeze will kiss away the tiredness from the strenuous hike, if any.

                     On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170 men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala. The entire State,
                     especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again.
                  
                    A visit to Kozhikode is incomplete without a visit to this legendary site. The spice route flourished through this Beach. A walk in and around the place gives one an idea of itshistorical relevance. The rocks and small hills add to its charm. The nearby shacks are always stocked with excellent local delicacies and tea. Migratory birds can be spotted occasionally as well. 
                    Kappad Beach is a truly majestic destination, which will always hold an important place in our history.

                    is an ancient seaport and city on the Malabar Coast of India bordering the Laccadive Sea, which is a part of the Arabian Sea. 
                    It is 71 km (44 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city is on the banks of Ashtamudi Lake and the Kallada river.
                     Kollam is the fourth largest city in Kerala and is known for cashew processing and coir manufacturing. It is the southern
                      gateway to the Backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination. Kollam is one of the most historic cities with
                       continuous settlements in India. Geographically, Quilon formation seen around coastal cliffs of Ashtamudi Lake, represent
                        sediments laid down in the Kerala basin that existed during Mio-Pliocene times
                        <br><br><br>
                        Kollam has a strong commercial reputation since ancient times. The Arabs, Phoenicians, Chinese, Ethiopians, Syrians, Jews,
                         Chaldeans and Romans have all engaged in trade at the port of Kollam for millennia. As a result of Chinese trade, Kollam was
                          mentioned by Ibn Battuta in the 14th century as one of the five Indian ports he had seen during the course of his twenty-four-year 
                          travels.[33][34] Desinganadu's rajas exchanged embassies with Chinese rulers while there was a flourishing Chinese settlement at
                           Kollam. In the ninth century, on his way to Canton, China, Persian merchant Sulaiman al-Tajir found Kollam to be the only port in 
                           India visited by huge Chinese junks. Marco Polo, the Venetian traveller, who was in Chinese service under Kublai Khan in 1275,
                            visited Kollam and other towns on the west coast, in his capacity as a Chinese mandarin.[35] Kollam is also home to one of the
                             seven churches that were established by St Thomas as well as one of the 10 oldest mosques believed to be found by Malik Deena
                             r in Kerala. Roman Catholic Diocese of Quilon is the first diocese in India

                     planned Ecotourism destination. It has 10 Ecotourism spots that cover the great hill ranges of Thiruvananthapuram, Pathanamthitta 
                      and Kollam districts. ‘Thenmala’ translates to 'Honey Hill' and so it is no surprise that high quality honey is exported from this
                       area. The surrounding dense forest is also known for the timber that is in much demand across the country. Its terrain is dotted by
                        forests, rubber and tree plantations and was selected by the World Tourism Organisation as one of the premier eco-friendly projects
                         in the world.

                     like mountain biking and rock climbing, we have you covered on all fronts. The staff is well trained in providing the required help and information 
                     at all times. Visits to the Thenmala Dam are open to tourists and the view is renowned all across the area. The sway bridge available at the Leisure Zone
                      is a favourite among children. The winding pathways, boardwalk and sculpture garden are all worth spending an evening at. The deep woods of
                       Thenmala contain specially made tree huts where one can escape into a separate zone in the forest. It is a surreal experience, vouched for by all
                        our visitors.

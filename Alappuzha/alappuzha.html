                <span class="firstLetter">A</span><br><p>lappuzha district  is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala. It was formed as 
                    Alleppey district on 17 August 1957, the name of the district being changed to Alappuzha in 1990,[5] and is the smallest district of Kerala.
                     Alleppey town, the district headquarters, was renamed Alappuzha in 2012, even though the anglicised name is still commonly used to 
                     describe the town as well as the district.

                    A town with canals, backwaters, beaches, and lagoons, Alappuzha was described by George Curzon, the British Governor-General 
                    of India in the beginning of the 20th century CE, as the "Venice of the Eastern world."[1] The district is best known for its 
                    picturesque Kerala Backwaters, by which it is well connected to other parts of Kerala, including the tourist destination of Kumarakom
                    , the district being a well known tourist destination in India. It is also known for its coir factories, as most 
                    of Kerala's coir industries are situated in and around the Alappuzha town.

                    <br><br><br>
                    The name Ᾱlappuzha is a toponym. ‘Ᾱlayam’ means ‘home’ and ‘puzha’, according to Dr. Herman Gundert's dictionary, means ‘watercourse’
                     or ‘river’. The name refers to the network of waterways and backwaters in Alappuzha and its surrounding areas. The district is bounded 
                     on the north by Kochi and Kanayannur taluks of Ernakulam district, on the east by Vaikom, Kottayam and Changanassery taluks of Kottayam 
                     district and Thiruvalla, Kozhencherry and Adoor taluks of Pathanamthitta district, on the South by Kunnathur and Karunagappally taluks of
                      Kollam district and on the west by Laccadive Sea

                     India, well known for its vast paddy fields and geographical peculiarities. The region has the lowest altitude in India, and is one of the few
                      places in the world where farming is carried on around 1.2 to 3.0 metres (4 to 10 ft) below sea level.[1][2] Kuttanad is historically important 
                      in the ancient history of South India and is the major rice producer in the state. Farmers of Kuttanad are famous for Biosaline Farming. Food and
                       Agriculture Organization (FAO) has declared the Kuttanad Farming System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) in 2013.

                    Four of Kerala's major rivers, the Pamba, Meenachil, Achankovil and Manimala flow into the region. It is well known for its boat race in the
                     Punnamada Backwaters, known in Malayalam as Vallamkalli.
                     <br><br><br>
                     Kuttanad has no recorded history on the origin of the land. But a blend of myths and legends is transferred from generation to generation 
                     orally among local people. Kuttanad was once believed to be a wild forest with dense tree growth which was destroyed subsequently by a wild fire.
                      Chuttanad (place of the burnt forest), was eventually called Kuttanad. Until the recent past burned black wooden logs were mined from paddy fields 
                      called as ‘Karinilam’(Black paddy fields). This fact substantiates the theory of Chuttanad evolving to Kuttanad. Ramankary, Puthukkary, Amichakary, 
                      Oorukkary, Mithrakary, Mampuzhakary, Kainakary, Chathurthiakary and Chennamkary are some familiar place names in Kuttanad.

                     Onam in spring. Vallam kali includes races of many kinds of paddled longboats and 'snake boats'. Each team spends about ₹6 lakhs 
                     for the Nehru Trophy Boat Race.[1]

                    In an effort to aggrandise this sport and showcase Kerala's backwaters to the world, the Government of Kerala initiated IPL

                     The lake has an area of 230 square kilometers and a maximum length of 96.5 km.[2] Spanning several districts in the state of Kerala,
                      it is known as Vembanadu Lake in Kottayam, Vaikom, Changanassery, Punnamada Lake in Alappuzha, Punnappra, Kuttanadu and Kochi Lake in

                        The Nehru Trophy Boat Race is conducted in a portion of the lake. High levels of pollution have been noticed at certain 
                        hotspots of the Vembanad backwaters.

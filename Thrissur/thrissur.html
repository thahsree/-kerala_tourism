                      called the Thekkinkaadu Maidaanam which seats a large Hindu Shiva Temple. It is located central of the state, and 304 kilometres
                       (189 mi) north-west of the state's capital city, Thiruvananthapuram. Thrissur was once the capital of the Kingdom of Cochin, and was 
                       a point of contact for the Assyrians, Greeks, Persians, Arabs, Romans, Portuguese, Dutch and English.    
                       
                       <br><br><br>Thrissur is also known as the Cultural Capital of Kerala because of its cultural, spiritual and religious leanings throughout history.

                    India on the Chalakudy River, which originates from the upper reaches of the Western Ghats at the entrance to the Sholayar ranges. 
                    It is the largest waterfall in Kerala, which stands tall at 81.5 feet. Just a short drive from Athirapilly to the Vazhachal Falls, 
                    which is close to dense green forests that are home to many endangered and endemic species of flora and fauna.

                    There is another waterfall on the way from Athirapilly to Vazhachal Falls, in close proximity to the road, which is locally called "Charpa Falls". Athirappilly Falls is the largest waterfall in Kerala and is nicknamed "The Niagara of South India".[1]
                    
                    Controversy about a state-proposed hydroelectric dam on the Chalakudy River above the waterfalls began in the 1990s and continued through 2017.

                     Located on the west-flowing Chalakudy River near the Vazhachal Forest Division and at the edge of the Sholayar ranges, 
                     it is just 5 km from entrance of Athirappilly Falls.  This waterfall, cascading on the edge of the Sholayar forest range has been categorized
                      as one of the finest present in India. The surroundings of the waterfalls offer rich natual views. Unlike Athirapally Waterfalls, 
                      Vazhachal flows through an inclined slope of more than 300 feet to descend into huge pool. It is very difficult and dangerous to step into the
                       flow or to reach the bottom of the flow. It is advised to limit your Vazhachal trip to enjoying the natural beauty of the falls.Vazhachal falls
                        is a great scenic place in an area of forests, where fury of water has become a beauty to behold. Stream appears to be very shallow in certain areas. 
                         there are plenty of rocks protruding all over water giving the impression that the stream can be easily walked over. 
                          There are several water parks and natural gardens located near to the region of the waterfall.

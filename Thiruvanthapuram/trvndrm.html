                    state of Kerala. It is the most populous city in Kerala with a population of 957,730 as of 2011. The encompassing urban agglomeration
                     population is around 1.68 million. Located on the west coast of India near the extreme south of the mainland, Thiruvananthapuram is 
                     a major information technology hub in Kerala and contributes 55% of the state's software exports as of 2016. Referred to by Mahatma Gandhi
                      as the "Evergreen city of India", the city is characterised by its undulating terrain of low coastal hills.

                    The present regions that constitute Thiruvananthapuram were ruled by the Ays who were feudatories of the Chera dynasty.In the 12th century,
                     it was conquered by the Kingdom of Venad. In the 18th century, the king Marthanda Varma expanded the territory, founded the princely 
                     state of Travancore, and made Thiruvananthapuram its capital. Travancore became the most dominant state in Kerala by defeating the
                      powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755. Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became 
                      the capital of Travancore–Cochin state and remained so until the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956         
                    <br><br><br>

                    Thiruvananthapuram is a notable academic and research hub and home to the University of Kerala, APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University,
                    the regional headquarters of Indira Gandhi National Open University, and many other schools and colleges. Thiruvananthapuram is also home
                    to research centers such as the National Institute for Interdisciplinary Science and Technology, Indian Space Research Organisation's Vikram 
                    Sarabhai Space Centre, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, National Centre for Earth Science Studies and a campus of the Indian
                    Institutes of Science Education and Research. The city is home to media institutions like Toonz India Ltd and Tata Elxsi Ltd, and is also home
                    to Chitranjali Film Studio, one of the first film studios in Malayalam Cinema, and Kinfra Film and Video Park at Kazhakoottom, which is India's
                    first Infotainment industrial park

                    The Museum is grounds to the Trivandrum Zoo, one of the oldest zoological gardens in India. The zoo was established in 1857 over 55 acres 
                    (220,000 m2) of land. It also contains the Sree Chitra Art Gallery, a separate art gallery established in 1935.
                    
                    The set of museums, along with the zoo, are managed by the Department of Museums and Zoos, a branch of the Department of Cultural Affairs of Kerala.
                    <br><br>

                    A building was constructed in 1857 during the reign of Uthram Thirunal Marthanda Varma, and later demolished in 1874 to lay foundation for a new 
                    building, during the reign of Ayilyam Thirunal.

                    The Governor of Madras in 1872 appointed Robert Chisholm, a consulting architect of the Madras Government to design a new museum. 
                    In 1880, construction finished and the museum opened to the public, bearing the namesake of its governor, Francis Napier, 10th Lord Napier.
                    
                    The Indo-Saracenic structure lacks an air conditioning system. Although it has never been an issue due to suitable natural ventilation,
                     an annex built in 2016 was noted for various problems such as mold, insects and corrosion owing to the lack of windows and openings. 
                     Since 2017, the annexed museum depot has been under review and is being rebuilt. Furthermore, the Napier Museum itself is being renovated.

                     the capital of the state of Kerala, India. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams, the sacred abodes of Vishnu in the Sri Vaishnava tradition.
                      It is widely considered as the world's richest Hindu temple.[1] The name of the city of 'Thiruvananthapuram' in Malayalam and Tamil 
                      translates to "The City of Ananta" (Ananta being a form of Vishnu).[2] The temple is built in an intricate fusion of the Kerala style
                       and the Dravidian style of architecture, featuring high walls, and a 16th-century gopuram.[3][4] While as per some traditions the 
                       Ananthapura temple in Kumbla in Kasaragod district in Kerala is considered as the original spiritual seat of the deity ("mulasthanam"),
                        architecturally to some extent, the temple is a replica of the Adikesava Perumal temple in Thiruvattar in Kanyakumari district in 
                        Tamil Nadu.

                    The principal deity is Padmanabhaswamy (Sanskrit: पद्मनाभस्वामि, IAST: Padmanābhasvāmi), a form of Vishnu enshrined in the "Anantashayana"
                     posture, engaged in eternal yogic sleep on his serpent mount, Shesha.[6] Padmanabhaswamy is the tutelary deity of the Travancore royal 
                     family. The titular Maharaja of Travancore, Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma, is the current trustee of the temple.

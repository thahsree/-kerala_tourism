                <span class="firstLetter">E</span><br><p>rnakulam  is the central business district of the city of Kochi, Kerala, India.
                     It is the namesake of Ernakulam district. The eastern part of Kochi city is mainly known as Ernakulam, while the western
                      part of it after the Venduruthy Bridge is called as Western Kochi. Many major establishments, including the Kerala High Court, 
                      the office of the Kochi Municipal Corporation and the Cochin Shipyard are situated in Ernakulam. It is also the most urbanized area
                       in the city of Kochi.
                       The word Ernakulam has a varied derivation, with some references to mythology and others to temples. According to Komattil Achutha Menon,
                        the word Erangiyal got its start from a particular kind of mud. In the past, Lord Shiva was referred to as Erayanar in Chennai. This was
                         done in Kerala as well, and it became known as Ernakulam after that. There are also other opinions about the origin of the name, saying
                          that Rishinagakulam became Ernakulam after losing it, but that the word Ernakulam came from Ernakulathappan Temple , and that it came from 
                          the word Kulam (Pond) for a long time because it was full of water bodies.
                          <br><br>

                          Under the Köppen climate classification, the city of Ernakulam features a Tropical monsoon climate.
                           Since the region lies in the south western coastal state of Kerala, the climate is tropical, with only minor
                            differences in temperatures between day and night, as well as over the year. 
                          Summer lasts from March to May, and is followed by the South-west monsoon from June to September.
                           October and November form the post monsoon or retreating monsoon season. Winter from December through February is slightly cooler, 
                           and windy, due to winds from the Western Ghats.

                     It is famous for the antique shops all along its sides.  The colonial buildings lining the street add to its old-world charm.
                     The Jews from Kodungallore were given shelter by the King of Kochi, in 1524. He allocated land in Mattancherry, near his palace, 
                     to them. This area later became Jew Town.
                     Take a walk along the Jew Town and you can breathe antiquity. The curio and antique shops along the street are capable of enchanting
                      the visitors with their variety and rarity.
                      <br><br>
                      The 20th century witnessed large-scale migration of Jews to Israel with the result that many dwellings on Jew Town became unoccupied. 
                      Antiques such as carved wooden furniture and vessels, as well as curios from these dwellings were collected and kept for
                      sale in the shops on Jew Town. Gradually, the demand for such items increased, especially among tourists. Consequently, there emerged many antique 
                      shops selling  articles of Indian, European, Chinese and Arab origin. Coupled with this growth was the appearance of many handicraft and garment shops
                       of ethnic products.

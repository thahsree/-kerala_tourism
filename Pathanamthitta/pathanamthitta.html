                <span class="firstLetter">T</span><br><p>he Sabarimala Sree Ayyappan Temple  is a Hindu temple that is devoted to the worship of a deity named Ayyappan,
                     also known as Dharma Shasta. Ayyappan is believed to be the son of Shiva and Mohini (Female avatar of Lord Vishnu). The temple is situated atop a hill 
                     in the village of Ranni-Perunad, within the Ranni Taluk of the Pathanamthitta district in the state of Kerala, India. The temple is surrounded by 
                     18 hills in the Periyar Tiger Reserve. It is one of the largest annual pilgrimage sites in the world, with an estimate of over 10 to 15 million devotees 
                     visiting every year.

                    The temple is open for worship only during the days of Mandala Pooja (approximately 15 November to 26 December), Makaravilakku or "Makara Sankranti"
                     (14 January), and Maha Thirumal Sankranti (14 April), and the first five days of each Malayalam month. The Sabarimala pilgrimage includes a unique 
                     tradition of offering prayer at the mosque of Vavar, a Muslim devotee of Ayappan.The Sabarimala Temple serves as a prime example of the amalgamation of 
                     several religious traditions within the Indian context
                     <br><br><br>
                     In the year 1991, a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) was initiated, leading to the Kerala High Court issuing a directive to the Devaswom Board to 
                     uphold the traditional practises of the temple. These practises encompassed the prohibition of women of a certain age group, rather than a blanket
                      exclusion of women, from accessing the temple premises.

                        On September 28, 2018, the Supreme Court of India rendered a decision, wherein a panel consisting of four male justices and one female judge voted by 
                        a majority of 4-1 to invalidate the prohibition on female entry inside the temple.
